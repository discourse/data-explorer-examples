Show me the number views each topic in a category has over a certain period of time. How many views do all topics in a category have? Accepts a `start_date`, `end_date`, and `category_name` parameter. 

--[params]
-- date :start_date = 2022-06-01
-- date :end_date = 2023-01-01
-- string :category_name

SELECT 
    c.name category,
    tv.topic_id,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_views
FROM topic_views tv
INNER JOIN topics t ON t.id = tv.topic_id
INNER JOIN categories c ON c.id = t.category_id
WHERE tv.viewed_at::date BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
    AND LOWER(c.name) LIKE LOWER(:category_name)
GROUP BY c.name, tv.topic_id
ORDER BY number_of_views DESC
