Show me a count of the unique anonymous and logged in users who viewed at least one topic over a selected timeframe. Includes a `start_date` and `end_date` parameter. How many anonymous and logged in users viewed at least one topic over a range of dates? 

--[params]
-- date :start_date = '2023-01-01'
-- date :end_date = '2024-01-01'
